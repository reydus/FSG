		<p>Summer is over and the academic year has once again started, and with that FSG has resumed weekly meetings. We're meeting tomorrow night and having a relaxed and informal get together so that people can come back and see the new lab (through the glass doors on the ground floor of the engineering building). We will be here from around 1.30pm until about 5/6pm.</p>
		<p>Next week there will be some interesting exercises running that demonstrate the possibilities of the sims alongside some excellent pizza. Please come down and have a look if you haven't already, this is a great society to become involved in whether you're looking to become a pilot OR an engineer.</p>
		<p>We're currently looking to change the meeting day from Wednesdays to a more suitable one; with 2nd year engineers having a revision lecture on Wednesday afternoons, and with many involved in sports, we don't want you sacrificing these for FSG. If you'd like to suggest a day, we're currently in the process of creating a poll for everyone to vote on. We'll keep you posted via <span class="fsg-link"><a href="https://www.facebook.com/groups/FSGLiverpool/" target="_blank">Facebook</a></span>!</p>

		<p>We hope you're all enjoying your summer, so we thought to add that extra touch of happiness we'd give you an update on what's been going on with FSG over summer!</p>

		<p>As most of you know, in June we began the process of moving rooms. With 3 simulators, a study space with multiple computers and a workshop this was no easy task. Initially we had to clear out everything in the room apart from the simulators, and the simulators themselves had to be dismantled to be moved, except for the Tomahawk sim. That went down through the labs using a crane, and was still in one piece afterwards!</p>
		</div>
		<div class="col-md-8 col-md-offset-2 fsg-info-1">
		<p>Both the FastJet and the Tomahawk now have their own 3-wall enclosures, and the Jetsim has its own station at the end of the room. The simulators are also now in their own room, separate from the computer area. We think it improves the look of the lab massively as now you have a whole room dedicated to simulators, whereas if you just want to do work then you can.</p>

		<div class="col-md-8 col-md-offset-2 fsg-info-1">
		<p>Come down and check the new room out if you haven't already!</p>
