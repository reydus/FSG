To Do

- Fix bootstrap way of messing around with allocated grids
- Simplify CSS (One CSS for each static HTML is silly)
- Delete one heck of a lot vestigial pages

Features:

- Who Are We
-- What are we
-- Where to find us (social media)
-- What do we do
-- Where we are
-- Who can seek us up

- The sims

Potential

- Gallery
-- A) Random unorganised photos
-- B) Categorised photos
Problems: Storage for the photos (low-size pics?) (Somebody please remind me how Apache allows use of internal files?)
